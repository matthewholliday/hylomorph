//! `harness-core` — the project-agnostic data and logic layer shared by every

//! The CLI (`harness-cli`) and the desktop GUI (`harness-gui`) both depend on
//! this crate. All run state lives on disk under `.harness/` and `.specs/`; the
//! modules here read, write, and validate that state. The [`snapshot`] module is
//! the UI-agnostic read model both front-ends render from.
